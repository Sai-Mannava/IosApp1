## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App 1: Strava - (Existing) Social Media App for runners, bikers and swimmers
      - I love the posts about workouts, fun runs, training it helps the running community stay connected.
      - I love the app's in-depth analysis software and Data it displays analyzing the run.
App 2: Gmail - (Existing) Online Formal Communication
      - The box format for each email is nice and I can just scroll through all of them.
      - The compose email icon is easy access.
App 3: Instagram - (Existing) Social Media
      - The colors and responsive text make the entire app so "appetizing". :)
      - The icons are so important all of them are neat and easy access.

I would like to build an app that is an improvement of Strava. The app right now is functional but if the app's design had features like dynamic topographical 3D maps to show hills and creeks  instead of the 2D version with the plain line that looks like a graph. I would also make text more responsive, it looks too plain like textbook. The running data is plus but the icons need work. Instead of a thumbs up button there should be a scale going from thumbs up to muscle flex emoji, this would make the app much more fun to use for people. All in all designing a new front-end for Strave would be a game changer for this app because its functional already, it just needs to be more inviting.

## Notes

A challenge was to locate where everything is but I got the hang of it after reading through a couple of Apple Developer pages
